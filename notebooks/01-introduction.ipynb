    "Python is a highly favorable choice for geospatial applications, demonstrating its versatility and efficiency in handling spatial data and geographical information systems (GIS). Its extensive set of libraries, such as Geopandas, Fiona, Shapely, and GDAL, empowers users to easily manipulate, analyze, and visualize geospatial data. Python's readability and simplicity make it accessible for both beginners and experienced developers, fostering a collaborative and inclusive geospatial community. Additionally, the integration of Python with powerful GIS tools like QGIS and ArcGIS further enhances its capabilities. The language's rich ecosystem extends to web mapping frameworks like Folium and interactive visualization libraries like Plotly, facilitating the creation of dynamic and engaging geospatial applications. Python's adaptability, combined with its strong community support, positions it as an excellent choice for addressing the diverse and evolving challenges within the geospatial domain.\n",

    "This workshop will provide an introduction to performing common GIS/geospatial\n",
    "tasks using Python geospatial tools such as OWSLib, Shapely, Fiona/Rasterio,\n",
    "and common geospatial libraries like GDAL, PROJ, pycsw, as well as other tools\n",
